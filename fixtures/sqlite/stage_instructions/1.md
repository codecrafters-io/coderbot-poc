In this stage, you'll implement one of SQLite's
[dot-commands](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#special_commands_to_sqlite3_dot_commands_): `.dbinfo`. This
command prints metadata about a SQLite database file.

The command is executed like this:

```
$ sqlite3 sample.db .dbinfo
```

It prints output in this format:

```
database page size:  4096
write format:        1
read format:         1

...

number of tables:    5
schema size:         330
data version:        1
```

We're only going to focus on one of these values: `database page size`. To find the page size, you'll need
to read the [database header](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#the_database_header). 

Here's how the tester will execute your program:

```
$ ./your_sqlite3.sh sample.db .dbinfo
```

and here's the output it expects (the number will vary depending on the test database):

```
database page size: 1024
```
