In this stage, you'll expand on the .dbinfo command from the last stage.

In the last stage we saw that the `.dbinfo` command prints output in this format:

```
database page size:  4096
write format:        1
read format:         1

...

number of tables:    5
schema size:         330
data version:        1
```

We implemented `database page size` in the last stage. In this stage, we'll focus on another value: `number of tables`. 
To find the number of tables, you'll need to count the number of rows in the
[`sqlite_schema`](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#storage_of_the_sql_database_schema) table.

Here's how the tester will execute your program:

```
$ ./your_sqlite3.sh sample.db .dbinfo
```

and here's the output it expects:

```
database page size: 4096
number of tables: 2
```
