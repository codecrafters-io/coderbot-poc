In this stage, you'll implement another dot-command:
[`.tables`](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#special_commands_to_sqlite3_dot_commands_).

Here's how the tester will execute your program:

```
$ ./your_sqlite3.sh sample.db .tables
```

and here's the output it expects:

```
apples   oranges
```

Notice how the table names are formatted with more than one space between each other? That's because `sqlite3`
formats its output so that every value has a fixed-width. Your program doesn't need to mimic this behaviour. Using
just one space as a separator should work. Both `apples oranges` and <code>apples &nbsp; oranges</code> will pass
our tests.
