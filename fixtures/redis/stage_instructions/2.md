In this stage, you'll respond to the
[PING](https://redis.io/commands/ping) command.

Your server should respond with `+PONG\r\n`, which is "PONG" encoded as a [RESP simple string](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#resp-simple-strings).

Since the tester client _only_ sends the PING command at the moment, it's okay to
ignore what the client sends and hardcode a response. We'll get to parsing
client input in later stages.
