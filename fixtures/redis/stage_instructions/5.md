In this stage, you'll respond to the
[ECHO](https://redis.io/commands/echo) command.

The client will send you the command as a RESP array, which looks
something like this:

```
*2\r\n$4\r\nECHO\r\n$3\r\nhey\r\n
```

server](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#send-commands-to-a-redis-server).
