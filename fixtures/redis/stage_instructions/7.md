In this stage, you'll need to support setting a key with an expiry. The
expiry is provided using the "PX" argument to the
[SET](https://redis.io/commands/set) command.

The tester will first send a `SET` command with an expiry, like this: `SET <key> <value> PX <expiry>`.
Then, it will send a `GET` command to retrieve the value, like this: `GET <key>`. If the key has expired, the 
tester will expect a Null value as the response. Read about "Null Bulk Strings" 
[here](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#resp-bulk-strings) to know how to send a Null value.
