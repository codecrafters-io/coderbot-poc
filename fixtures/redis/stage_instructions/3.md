In this stage, you'll respond to multiple
[PING](https://redis.io/commands/ping) commands sent by the same connection.

To test your implementation using the [official Redis CLI](https://redis.io/docs/ui/cli/), you can start your server using 
`./spawn_redis_server.sh` and then run `echo -e "ping\nping" | redis-cli` from your terminal. This will send two PING commands
using the same connection.

In most languages, you'd need to run a loop that reads input from a connection and sends a
response back. In JavaScript however, if you're listening to the
[`data`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_event_data) event, this should be automatically handled for you. **It
is very likely that the code you had for the previous stage will pass this stage without any changes!**
