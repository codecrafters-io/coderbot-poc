In this stage, your server will need to handle multiple concurrent
clients. Just like the previous stages, all clients will only send `PING`
commands for now.

In most languages, you'd need to either use threads or implement an
[Event Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop) to do this. In JavaScript however, since [the concurrency
model itself is based on an event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop), most
standard library functions are designed to support this kind of concurrent behaviour out of the box. **It is very
likely that the code you had for the previous stage will pass this stage without any changes!**

To achieve this, you'll need to either use threads, or, if you're feeling
adventurous, an [Event Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop) (like
the official Redis implementation does).
