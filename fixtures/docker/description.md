In this challenge, you'll build a toy Docker implementation that can pull an
image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and execute commands in it.
Along the way, you'll learn about
[chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot), [kernel
namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces), the [docker
registry API](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/) and much more.
