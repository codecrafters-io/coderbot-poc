In this stage, you’ll decode a bencoded list value.

Lists are encoded as `l<bencoded_elements>e`.

For example, `["hello", 52]` would be encoded as `l5:helloi52ee`. Note that there are no separators between the elements.

Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
```
$ ./your_bittorrent.sh decode l5:helloi52ee
[“hello”,52]
```
