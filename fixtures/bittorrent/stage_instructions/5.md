In this stage, you'll parse a torrent file and print information about the torrent.

A torrent file (also known as a [metainfo file](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#metainfo-files)) contains a bencoded dictionary with the following values:

- `announce`:
    - URL to a "tracker", which is a central server that keeps track of peers participating in the sharing of a torrent.
- `info`:
    - A dictionary with keys:
        - `length`: size of the file in bytes, for single-file torrents
        - `name`: suggested name to save the file / directory as
        - `piece length`: number of bytes in each piece
        - `pieces`: concatenated SHA-1 hashes of each piece

**Note**: The `info` dictionary looks slightly different for multi-file torrents. For this challenge, we'll only implement support for single-file torrents.

In this stage, we'll focus on extracting the tracker URL and the length of the file (in bytes).

Here’s how the tester will execute your program:

```
$ ./your_bittorrent.sh info sample.torrent
```

and here’s the output it expects:

```
Tracker URL: http://bittorrent-test-tracker.codecrafters.io/announce
Length: 1048500
```
