Info hash is a unique identifier for a torrent file. It's used when talking to trackers or peers.

In this stage, you'll calculate the info hash for a torrent file and print it in hexadecimal format.

To calculate the info hash, you'll need to:

- Extract the `info` dictionary from the torrent file
- Bencode the contents of the `info` dictionary, and calculate the SHA-1 hash

Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
```
$ ./your_bittorrent.sh info sample.torrent
```
and here’s the output it expects:
```
Tracker URL: http://bittorrent-test-tracker.codecrafters.io/announce
Length: 1048500
Info Hash: c77829d2a77d6516f88cd7a3de1a26abcbfab0db
```
