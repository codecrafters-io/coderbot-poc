In this stage, we'll add support for [negative character groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions#negative-character-group-).

Negative character groups match any character that is not present within a pair of square brackets.

**Example:** `[^abc]` should match "dog", but not "cab" (since all characters are either "a", "b" or "c").

Your program will be executed like this: 

```bash
$ echo "apple" | ./your_grep.sh -E "[^abc]"
```

You program must exit with 0 if the input contains characters that aren't part of the negative character group, and 1 if not.
