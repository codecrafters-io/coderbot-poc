In this stage, we'll add support for [positive character groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions#positive-character-group--).

Positive character groups match any character that is present within a pair of square brackets.

**Example:** `[abc]` should match "apple", but not "dog".

Your program will be executed like this: 

```bash
$ echo "apple" | ./your_grep.sh -E "[abc]"
```

You program must exit with 0 if an any of the characters are found in the string, and 1 if not.
