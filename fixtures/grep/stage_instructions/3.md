In this stage, we'll implement support for the `\w` 
[character class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes).

`\w` matches any alphanumeric character (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`).

**Example:** `\w` should match "foo101", but not "$!?".

Your program will be executed like this: 

```bash
$ echo "alpha-num3ric" | ./your_grep.sh -E "\w"
```

You program must exit with 0 if an alphanumeric character is found in the string, and 1 if not.
