In this stage, we'll add support for the `|` keyword, which allows combining multiple patterns in an either/or fashion.

**Example**: `(cat|dog)` should match "dog" and "cat", but not "apple".

Your program will be executed like this: 

```bash
$ echo "cat" | ./your_grep.sh -E "(cat|dog)"
```

You program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.
