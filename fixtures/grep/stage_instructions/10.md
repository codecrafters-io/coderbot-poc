In this stage, we'll add support for `?`, the [zero or one](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/quantifiers-in-regular-expressions#match-one-or-more-times-) quantifier (also known as the "optional" quantifier).

**Example**: `dogs?` should match "dogs" and "dog", but not "cat".

Your program will be executed like this: 

```bash
$ echo "dogs" | ./your_grep.sh -E "dogs?"
```

You program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.
