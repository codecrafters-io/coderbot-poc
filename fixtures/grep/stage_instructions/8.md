In this stage, we'll add support for `$`, the [End of String or Line anchor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/anchors-in-regular-expressions#start-of-string-or-line-).

`$` doesn't match a character, it matches the end of a line.

**Example:** `dog$` should match "dog", but not "dogs".

Your program will be executed like this: 

```bash
$ echo "dog" | ./your_grep.sh -E "dog$"
```

You program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.
