In this stage, we'll add support for `^`, the [Start of String or Line anchor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/anchors-in-regular-expressions#start-of-string-or-line-). 

`^` doesn't match a character, it matches the start of a line.

**Example:** `^log` should match "log", but not "slog".

Your program will be executed like this: 

```bash
$ echo "log" | ./your_grep.sh -E "^log"
```

You program must exit with 0 if the input starts with the given pattern, and 1 if not.
