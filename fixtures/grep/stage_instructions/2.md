In this stage, we'll implement support for the `\d` 
[character class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes).

`\d` matches any digit. 

**Example:** `\d` should match "3", but not "c".

Your program will be executed like this: 

```bash
$ echo "apple123" | ./your_grep.sh -E "\d"
```

You program must exit with 0 if a digit is found in the string, and 1 if not.
