In this stage, we'll add support for `.`, which matches any character.

**Example**: `d.g` should match "dog", but not "cog".

Your program will be executed like this: 

```bash
$ echo "dog" | ./your_grep.sh -E "d.g"
```

You program must exit with 0 if the input matches the given pattern, and 1 if not.
