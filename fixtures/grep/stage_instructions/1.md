In this stage, we'll handle the simplest regex possible: a single character. 

**Example:** `a` should match "apple", but not "dog".

Your program will be executed like this: 

```bash
$ echo "apple" | ./your_grep.sh -E "a"
```

The `-E` flag instructs `grep` to interprets patterns as extended regular expressions (with support 
for metacharacters like `+`, `?` etc.). We'll use this flag in all stages.

You program must [exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) with 0 if the character is found, and 1 if not.
