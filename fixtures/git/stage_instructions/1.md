In this stage, you'll implement the `git init` command. This command
initializes a repository by creating a `.git` directory and some files
inside it.

You can read more about what's inside the `.git` folder
[here](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/03/23/whats-inside-your-git-directory.html).

For the purposes of this challenge, you'll only need to create the bare
minimum required for Git to function properly:

```
- .git/
  - objects/
  - refs/
  - HEAD (should contain "ref: refs/heads/master\n")
```
