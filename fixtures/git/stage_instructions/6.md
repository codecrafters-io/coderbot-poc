Let's move on to the last git object we'll be dealing with in this
challenge: [the commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects#_git_commit_objects).

To create a commit, you'll need the following information:

- Committer/Author name + email
- Timestamp
- Tree SHA
- Parent commit SHA(s), if any

In this stage, you'll implement [`git
commit-tree`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-tree), a plumbing
command that creates a commit.

Your program will be invoked like this:

```
./your_git.sh commit-tree <tree_sha> -p <commit_sha> -m <message>
```

You'll receive exactly one parent commit, and exactly one line in the
message. You're free to hardcode any valid name/email for the
author/committer fields.

Your program must create a commit object and print its 40-char SHA to
stdout.

To verify your changes, the tester will read the commit object from the
`.git` directory. It'll use the `git show` command to do this.
