In the previous stage, we learnt how to read a blob. In this stage, you'll
add a blob to your git repository by implementing the [`git
hash-object`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-hash-object) command.

Your program will be called like so:

```
./your_git.sh hash-object -w <file>
```

It is expected to store the data from `<file>` as a blob in `.git/objects`
and print a 40-char SHA to stdout.

To verify your implementation, the tester will try to read the blob your
program wrote. It'll do this using [`git
cat-file`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cat-file), the command you
implemented in the previous stage.

```
git cat-file -p <blob_sha>
```
