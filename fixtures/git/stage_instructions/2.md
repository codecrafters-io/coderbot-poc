In this challenge, we'll deal with three [Git
objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects):

  - blobs
  - trees
  - commits

Let's start with blobs, which represent files (binary data, to be
precise).

In this stage, you'll read a blob from your git repository by fetching its
contents from the `.git/objects` directory.

You'll do this using the first of multiple ["plumbing"
commands](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)
we'll encounter in this challenge: [`git
cat-file`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cat-file).

Your program will be called like so:

```
./your_git.sh cat-file -p <blob_sha>
```

It is expected to print out the binary data that the blob contains. 

In many programming languages the default print function (like [`fmt.Println`](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt#example-Println)) 
will append a newline to the output. The output of `cat-file` must not contain a 
newline at the end, so you might need to use a different function to print the output.

Keep in mind that Git uses [Zlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) to
compress objects. You can use Python's built-in
[zlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html) library to read these
compressed files.

Keep in mind that Git uses [Zlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) to
compress objects. You can use Ruby's built-in
[Zlib](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/Zlib.html)
library to read these compressed files.

Keep in mind that Git uses [Zlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) to
compress objects. You can use Go's built-in
[compress/zlib](https://golang.org/pkg/compress/zlib/) package to read
these compressed files.

Keep in mind that Git uses [Zlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) to
compress objects. You can use the
[flate2](https://crates.io/crates/flate2) crate to read these compressed
files, we've included it in the `Cargo.toml` file.
