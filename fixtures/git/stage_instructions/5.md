Now that you know how to read a tree object, let's put your new found
skills to test - can you _write_ a tree?

Here's how the tester will invoke your program:

```
./your_git.sh write-tree
```

You're expected to write the entire working directory as a tree object,
and print the 40-char SHA.

Caveat: Unlike the official Git implementation, we aren't going to
implement a staging area (the place where things go when you run `git
add`). We'll just assume that all files in the working directory are
staged. If you're testing this against `git` locally, make sure to run
`git add .` before `git write-tree`.

To verify your implementation, the tester will read the tree object from
the `.git` directory.
