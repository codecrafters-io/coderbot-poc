This is the last stage of the challenge, and probably the hardest.

In this stage, you'll clone a public repository from GitHub. To do this,
you'll use Git's [Smart HTTP transfer
protocol](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/http-protocol).

{{#lang_is_rust}}
You can use the [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) crate to make
HTTP requests, we've included it in the `Cargo.toml` file.
{{/lang_is_rust}}

Your program will be invoked like this:

```
./your_git.sh clone https://github.com/blah/blah <some_dir>
```

Your program must create `<some_dir>` and clone the given repository into
it.

To verify your changes, the tester will do the following:

- Check the contents of a file
- Read commit object attributes from the `.git` directory
