Now that we've learnt how to read/write blobs, let's move onto our next
Git object: [the tree](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/trees/).

In this stage, you'll implement the [`git
ls-tree`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-ls-tree) command, which is used to
inspect a tree object.

The tester will execute your program like this:

```
./your_git.sh ls-tree --name-only <tree_sha>
```

For a directory structure like this:

```
your_repo/
  - file1
  - dir1/
    - file_in_dir_1
    - file_in_dir_2
  - dir2/
    - file_in_dir_3
```

The output expected is:

```
dir1
dir2
file1
```

(Note that the output is alphabetically sorted, this is how Git stores
entries in the tree object internally)
