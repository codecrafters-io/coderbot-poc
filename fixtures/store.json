A piece is usually 256 KB or 1 MB in size.\n\nEach piece is assigned a SHA-1 hash value. On public networks, there may be malicious peers that send fake data. These hash values allow us to verify the integrity of each piece that we'll download.\n\nPiece length and piece hashes are specified in the `info` dictionary of the torrent file under the following keys:\n\n- `piece length`: number of bytes in each piece, an integer\n- `pieces`: concatenated SHA-1 hashes of each piece (20 bytes each), a string\n\nThe [BitTorrent Protocol Specification](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#info-dictionary) has more information about these keys.\n\nIn this stage, the tester will expect your program to print piece length and a list of piece hashes in hexadecimal format.\n\nHere's how the tester will execute your program:\n```\n$ ./your_bittorrent.sh info sample.torrent\n```\nand here's the output it expects:\n```\nTracker URL: http://bittorrent-test-tracker.codecrafters.io/announce\nLength: 1048500\nInfo Hash: c77829d2a77d6516f88cd7a3de1a26abcbfab0db\nPiece Length: 262144\nPiece Hashes:\nddf33172599fda84f0a209a3034f79f0b8aa5e22\n795a618a1ee5275e952843b01a56ae4e142752ef\ncdae2ef532d611a46b2cf7b64d578c09b3ac0b6e\n098dadc0c19436f1927ea27b90eb18b1a2820a23\n```\n",
